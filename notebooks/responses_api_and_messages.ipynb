    "# Managing Conversation State with OpenAI's API\n",

    "\n",
    "### Manually managing conversation state: \n",
    "Building a conversation history list and appending messages for each turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chaining responses using previous_response_id: \n",

    "## 1. Manual Conversation State Management\n",
    "For this first example, we'll create a simple knock-knock joke conversation by manually constructing a conversation history. Each turn of the conversation is stored in a list of messages, where each message is a dictionary containing the role (user or assistant) and its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to state management is explicit and works well when you need fine-grained control over the conversation history."
